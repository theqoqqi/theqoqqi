#### About me:

By day, I work on CRM/ERP platforms and business-critical stuff — APIs for mobile and desktop apps, VoIP clients, you name it. NDAs keep the details secret, but in my free time I love tinkering with game mods and handy tools.
However, during my free time, I immerse myself in crafting diverse pet projects, some of which include:

1. **Minecraft [Mod](https://github.com/theqoqqi/QCraft) and [Datapack](https://github.com/theqoqqi/QStructs)**:
I cooked up a Minecraft mod packed with crafting puzzles, surprise loot boxes, new creatures, items, and some new structures. The matching datapack drops you into sprawling ancient cities built from endless ruins, all hiding treasure just waiting to be found.

2. **Dota 2 [Randy Arena](https://github.com/theqoqqi/randyarena) Custom Game Mode**:
An 8-player arena where chaos reigns — new rules, custom map, new items, and even some legendary items brought back from retirement. It's fast, it's fierce, and it's a ton of fun.

3. **Totem Tribe [Map Editor](https://github.com/theqoqqi/tteditor)**:
I got nostalgic for an old casual game I loved as a kid, but hated its clunky map editor. So I built my own smooth, user-friendly editor to make crafting levels a breeze.

4. **UE4.27 [UAsset Diff Tool](https://github.com/theqoqqi/uasset-diff-tool)**:
A CLI tool I whipped up to compare `.uasset` files in Unreal Engine 4.27. It helps modders spot changes in the game assets when you don't have the original files.

Additionally, I love bringing numerous ideas to life, and some of them are available on my profile. However, it's worth mentioning that among them, you may stumble upon some charmingly unfinished ones too! 😄

Beyond my personal projects, I find great joy in mentoring my friends, guiding them in programming, and assisting them with questions they may have.

Feel free to browse through my repos! There is some cookies 🍪
